I am a microbiologist at the University of Exeter, primarily interested in AMR in bacterial communities, and how ecological factors can affect AMR. I am a postdoc, who likes to use R to analyse fairly large datasets, mostly involving sequence data. I have experience in processing and analysing metagenomic data using various bioinformatics pipelines, but I am definitely not an expert. Always happy to learn more :)  

Here is where the data (except for sequencing data which will be deposited at ENA) and code for my publications will live :)
