# readme
I am a microbiologist at the University of Exeter, primarily interested in AMR in bacterial communities, and how ecological factors can affect AMR. I am a baby postdoc, who likes to use R (somewhat successfully) to analyse fairly large datasets, mostly involving sequence data. I have experience in processing and analysing metagenomic data using various bioinformatics pipelines but am no means an expert. 

Here is where the data (except for sequencing data which will be deposited at ENA) and code for my publications will live :)
